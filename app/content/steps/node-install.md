NPM is a package manager that comes with [node.js](http://nodejs.org).
We'll use it to install packages our project needs, we call these dependencies.
If you don't yet have node.js installed, go [install](http://nodejs.org) it now.

Once installed, open or restart your terminal and run `npm`.
You should see help on how to use it, you're all set.
If you get an error saying the command wasn't found, ensure it is installed and your system `$PATH` variable includes the path to `npm`.
