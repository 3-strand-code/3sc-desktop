[Node.js][2] is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
We'll use it to run web apps and server apps.

[npm][1] is a package manager that comes with node.
We'll use it to install packages our project needs, we call these dependencies.

Looks like you don't yet have node.js installed, let's go [install][2] it now.
