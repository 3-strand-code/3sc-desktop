Let's initialize `npm` in this repo.
This allows us to do many useful things like:

1. Save dependencies that our project depends on
1. Create scripts that run at various times in the lifecycle of our package
1. Publish our project as a module others can install

This command will ask you a few questions and create a [package.json][1] in the root of the project.
You can press `enter` to accept any default value if you are unsure what to answer. 

```shell
$ npm init
```
